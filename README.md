# CS449 Semester Project
The goal of this project is full implementation of an SOS game across several 2-week sprints.

## Sprint 0
* Basic GUI experimentation, drawing to screen.
* Code is unlikely to be reused and is not well-documented as it was for information-gathering and learning purposes before defining specific project goals and user stories.
